Sometime after the war the property was acquired by Manti Improvement Business Association and subsequently leased to various companies, which included a textile company that produced Nike and Patagonia gear, and Hunter Composites, a fiberglass composite column manufacturer. Sampling was conducted at the site in February 2013 for soil, sub-slab, and indoor air. Benzene and ethylbenzene exceeded indoor air sample industrial screening levels. Benzene and chlorinated solvents were found in sub-slab samples. Eight mercury containing thermostats and PCP/DEHP-containing light ballasts were encountered within the building. Lead based paint and asbestos containing material are also present. Manti is interested in pursuing cleanup work for the property, and because the roof of the existing building is in disrepair and potentially structurally unstable, the city may demolish the building to create a greenspace.",13
